# Bachelor Thesis & Cross-Country Skiing Analytics (CCSA)

## Introduction
This repository contains the code base for my Bachelor Thesis and the Cross-Country Skiing Analytics (CCSA) project. The aim of the thesis is to develop a labelling tool for cross-country skiing related video footage, focusing on aspects like image matching and pose estimation, utilizing Python for data analysis and processing.

## Installation
To use this project, clone the repository and set up the environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/magictoene/BachelorThesis.git
cd BachelorThesis
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate [env_name]
```

## Features
Feature extraction from cross-country skiing video data.



## Documentation
The repository includes Python scripts for data processing and analysis, as well as an environment file for setting up the project. For detailed documentation, refer to in-line comments within each script.
